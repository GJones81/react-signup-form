# Lab: Sign up Form

Forms are something you will frequently use in `React.js`.

This lab uses what students have learned so far to create a sign up form using `reactstrap`. Alternatively, you may use another UI framework like Material UI.

In the starter code, you'll find a `create-react-app` project with `reactstrap` installed! If you'd like to use something other than `reactstrap`, simply install that one instead.

> NOTE: `reactstrap` is different from `react-bootstrap`, make sure you're looking at the right docs!

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:

-   React and React components
-   File tree and component structure
-   State
-   Props
-   Unidirectional data flow
-   Using documentation

## Instructions

1.  Fork and Clone this repo
2.  `npm install` (Hint! Same as `npm i`!)  
3.  `npm start`
4.  Complete requirements and do bonus additions!
5.  Make a pull request to submit your work.

## Requirements

Build a sign up form using `create-react-app` and a UI Framework of your choice to collect the name, email, picture, and hidden password for a user. `console.log` what the user's inputs when they submit the form.

You should have:

* Three text input fields: Name, Email, Password
* File upload input
* One Button to Submit input
* Submit should have a listener event that triggers a function and `console.log`s the user's input and the blob for the image.

> NOTE: This form doesn't actually do anything. It is for styling practice.

## Bonus

- Add custom styles and a "logo" to personalize the site.
- Show custom error messages for incomplete fields
- Show a success alert when the form is submitted
- Implement icons to add to your from [React Font Awesome 5](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome)
- Put your form into a modal
- Validate that the email is a valid email address
